# Relation Extration on PubMed Dataset
Project Objective - This project aims to formulate a better framework of obtaining entity relation dataset from text documents. Specifically, we will perform entity extraction from text documents in PubMed dataset, get the phrases connecting every pair of entities, summarize the relations, and cluster the summarizations so similar relationships can be described by a centroid term.
